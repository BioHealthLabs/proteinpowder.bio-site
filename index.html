                <h2>How to choose the right protein powder</h2>
                <p>
                    Stronger is not always better – and “more grams” is not the whole story.
                    Think about your diet, digestion and actual goals before you buy.
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Check your diet first:</strong> if you already eat a lot of meat, eggs and dairy, you may need less powder.</li>
                    <li><strong>Whey vs plant:</strong> whey is usually best for fast recovery; plant-based is ideal if you avoid dairy.</li>
                    <li><strong>Look past marketing:</strong> ignore “anabolic” claims and focus on protein per serving and ingredients.</li>
                    <li><strong>Start simple:</strong> vanilla or chocolate from a reputable brand is often enough.</li>

                <p>
                    The same tub of protein can be used for bulking or cutting – the difference is your
                    total calories, carbs and training.

                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Muscle gain:</strong> use protein shakes to help hit a small calorie surplus and 1.6–2.2 g protein per kg bodyweight.</li>
                    <li><strong>Fat loss:</strong> keep protein high but overall calories lower. Protein helps you stay full while dieting.</li>
                    <li><strong>Everyday health:</strong> 20–30 g protein in a shake can plug gaps when you’re busy or on the go.</li>

            <h3>How much protein do I actually need per day?</h3>
            <p>
                Most lifters and active people do well with around <strong>1.6–2.2 g protein per kg</strong> of bodyweight per day.
                You do not need to go far beyond this – more is not always better.
            </p>

            <h3>Do I need protein powder to build muscle?</h3>
            <p>
                No. You can hit your protein target with food alone. Protein powder is simply a convenient way to fill gaps,
                especially if you struggle to eat enough or are on the go.
            </p>

            <h3>Is whey protein bad for my kidneys?</h3>
            <p>
                In healthy people with normal kidney function, higher protein intake has not been shown to damage kidneys.
                If you have kidney disease or other medical conditions, talk to your doctor before changing your diet.
            </p>

            <h3>Can teenagers use protein powder?</h3>
            <p>
                Teens who are training hard sometimes use protein powder to support their intake, but whole foods should still be the base.
                Parents and healthcare professionals should be involved if there are concerns about growth, health or eating patterns.
